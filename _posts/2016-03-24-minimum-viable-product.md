It has been quite a long time since my last post. I was swamped at work and I wasn't able to write anything valuable. However, I was working on different open source project - [react-image-gallery](https://github.com/luckyluk92/react-image-gallery/tree/extracting), which I need .t work I forked it and make it a little bit more flexible, but it isn't perfect yet.

Anyway, since my [last post](http://dev.kielczykowski.pl/2016/03/11/faces-of-webpack/) I have been thinking about my approach on the [reactive-blog](https://github.com/luckyluk92/reactive-blog) project and the blog itself. I realised that:

* I have to write short posts, writing more about progress and not trying to create guides,
* gradually increase the complexity.

## MVP
MVP is an abbreviation for Minimum Viable Product. In my case, I want to start with the simplest blog, without any managing tools. I still will be using React and Redux though, even if it breaks the second point from above a little bit. I will be gradually increasing complexity within front's architecture.

I created a [PR](https://github.com/luckyluk92/reactive-blog/pull/2) which will be the mvp of the reactive-blog. I put a checklist (which will be updated) there with elements I want to include in first version. For now, I will focus on frontend and adding posts will have to be done through terminal.

I promise, next post will be code oriented :)
