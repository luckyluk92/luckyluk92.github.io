## Introduction
This is the first post of upcoming series for [Daj Się Poznać](http://www.maciejaniserowicz.com/daj-sie-poznac/) competition. The goal is to develop some open-source project and write about it. That is all. So, within next 10 weeks I will deliver posts about the most interesting parts of *Reactive Blog* and experiences gained from developing it.  

## What is *Reactive Blog*?
*Reactive Blog*, as the name indicates, will be a blog engine. I know it is not a very innovative project, but it can contain a lot of features and this is why I decided make a blog engine (besides, second reason, I have never made one!).  

The lessons I want to take from this project are to learn how to use Webpack, new techniques, how to use Redux, to deepen knowledge about React and how to express my thoughts in more clear way. In the other words, I want to become event better developer, which is (I think) an ultimate goal of this competition.

## Tools
I will be using Ruby on Rails as a backend framework and React with Redux in frontend. These are the most interesting.  Why Rails you may ask if my [About](/about) page says that I work with Rails everyday. I do, and I feel quite comfortable with it, but I know as well that there are a lot of things that my knowledge covers poorly and of course, there are different techniques that I can use.

## Wrapping Up
I hope that you are not discourage from following my project and my blog because it is about creating a blog engine. I will try to deliver interesting content.

Anyway, if you have some questions, suggestions or you just want to say "Hello", feel free to leave a comment.
