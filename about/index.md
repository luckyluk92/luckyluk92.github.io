Hello there! I'm Łukasz Kiełczykowski. Now, when we are introduced to ourselves, let me tell you about myself little bit.

I'm working as a full stack developer at [Tokagen](http://tokagen.com), where I mainly use Ruby on Rails and React. Even though I'm de facto Ruby developer, I started my programming journey with C and then C#. I had and still have a lot of fun with C# within [MonoGame](www.monogame.net) or, more frequently, [Unity](www.unity3d.com).

I always try my best to write clean and understandable code by figuring out the right abstraction.

Outside the programming world, I ~~try~~ play on my guitar which gives me a lot of satisfaction, I make small steps in skydiving and I love driving my little blue car.
